## Roadmap

<!-- PM: Reorder by priority as needed. Add new items as they come up in team meetings. -->

| Priority | Item | Details | Status |
|----------|------|---------|--------|
| 1 | RDBMS → S3 Data Lake | Periodic data export from Aurora to S3. Needs functional spec. | Not started |
| 2 | Data Vectorization | Generate embeddings from exported data. Tech selection needed. | Not started |
| 3 | Vector DB Setup | Evaluate Pinecone, Weaviate, pgvector, etc. | Not started |
| 4 | Saayam AI Agent | Agent that queries vector DB with Saayam's own data. | Not started |
| 5 | Content Safety | Sentiment analysis (#87), translation for content filtering (#86). | Stale |
| 6 | Analytics Dashboard | Super Admin analytics (#81-89). Data Analytics team scope. | Stale |

These align with Rao's long-term directive:

```
PostgreSQL (RDBMS) → S3 Data Lake → Vectorize → Vector DB → AI Agent
```
